# Aspiring Health Informatics Student
## About Me
Greetings,  
I am an aspiring Health Informatics student who is looking forward to working as a healthcare data analyst.  
In addition to my experience working in a healthcare environment, I also have experience in research. My major is Biotechnology.
I believe that my experience and knowledge in the field of healthcare, together with the technical skills that I learned in and out of school, will be a great asset for me to become a data analyst that helps improving patient outcomes by achieving business goals.

## Personal Projects
### [Heart Disease Prediction](portfolio/jupyter-notebook/heart_disease/heart_disease.md)
**Goal**: To predict patients with heart disease using KNN and logistic model.

**About the dataset**: This dataset was collected, published and used by machine learning researchers.

**Skill**: Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn), data analysis, data visualization, machine learning, KNN, logistic.

### Analyze the effect of sleep on blood pressure - [R](http://rpubs.com/dcdanh98/1277151) | [Python](portfolio/jupyter-notebook/md-kaggle-sleep_health/kaggle-sleep_health.md)
**Goal**: To discover the effect of sleep and other factors on blood pressure. 

**Description**: Sleep is a process that allows your body to rest, repair and restore itself. On average, depends on a personâ€™s constitution, we need from six to eight hours of sleep everyday. More or less than that will usually come with negative effects on the body. during this project, we will learn more about the effect of sleep (and some other factors) on blood pressure.

**About the dataset**: This is a simulated dataset. This dataset does not come from a real life scenario, and can only be used for education purpose.

**Skill**: R (programming language), Python (numpy, pandas, matplotlib), data analysis, data visualization.

### The effect of age, BMI and some other factors on blood pressure - [R](https://rpubs.com/dcdanh98/1279332) | [Python](portfolio/jupyter-notebook/md_cn_blood-pressure/cn_blood-pressure.md)
**Scenario**: Imagine yourself as an analyst of a pharmaceutical company that just developed a new medicine for patients with high blood pressure. The company now wants to know how to maximize the sales by advertising the new medication to those who are susceptible to it.

**Goal**: Find the group of people that has higher risk of having high blood pressure.

**About the dataset**: This dataset was collected by Yongbo Liang et al. (2018). This dataset contains information of 219 patients in China, together with 13 variables. The dataset covers an age range of 20-89 years and records of diseases including hypertension and diabetes. 

**Skill**: R (programming language), Python (numpy, pandas, seaborn), data analysis, data visualization.

### [Using Machine Learning Models on Alzheimer Dataset](https://rpubs.com/dcdanh98/1284185)
**Goal**: Find the model that gives the best prediction for the dataset. The prediction rate was calculated by the proportion of correct classification. The dataset was splitted into training and testing set (80:20 split, cross validation and bootstrap).

**About the dataset**: This dataset was created by Rabie El Kharoua (2024), and published on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/dsv/8668279). This dataset contains 2149 observations and 35 variables, including the diagnosis of Alzheimer.

**Skill**: R (programming language), machine learning, logistic, LDA, QDA, KNN, cross validation, bootstrap.
